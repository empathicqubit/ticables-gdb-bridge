# ticables-gdb-bridge

There are two programs:

* tibridge: Connects a TI calculator running the [GDB stub](https://github.com/empathicqubit/z88dk-gdbstub) to the computer via any link cable supported by the tilibs project.
* tikeys: Remotely launch an application on the calculator using a few different methods.
Currently the only one that works end to end is [Noshell](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/400/40005.html).
